Not all of these solutions are particularly good.

  I did consider reference style links, and they didn't seem much better.
  Just try and view the formatted table, if you can.

I have some scripts set up to make working on problems a smoother experience:

 - [`addSolution.rb`](addSolution.rb) takes a problem number, creates the associated folder and file, and copies the problem's prompt from the website.
 - [`generateReadme.rb`](generateReadme.rb) generates this readme based on the files in the solutions folder.

Some of the scripts were reused from [my Project Euler solutions](https://github.com/zsarge/ProjectEuler).
