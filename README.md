## I am taking a break to focus on exams.

I will be done back before the end of advent.

## Code Quality

These solutions emphasize readability.

While readability is a subjective metric,
I really just don't want these solutions to
look like code golf.

## Miscellaneous

I have some scripts set up to make working on problems a smoother experience:

 - [`addSolution.rb`](addSolution.rb) takes a problem number, creates the associated folder and solution template, and creates an input file to paste into.
 - [`generateReadme.rb`](generateReadme.rb) generates this readme based on the files in the solutions folder.

Some of the scripts were reused from [my Project Euler solutions](https://github.com/zsarge/ProjectEuler).

[In 2020, I tried to solve each day in a different language.](https://github.com/zsarge/AdventOfCode2020) That was a pain, and I'm not doing that again this year.
